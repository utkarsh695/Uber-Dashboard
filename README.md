‚Ä¢ Business Problem

Uber generates millions of daily rides worldwide, but managers often lack an easy way to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as cancellations, revenue loss, profitability, and service ratings across car categories.

Key questions include:

What percentage of bookings are cancelled and what impact does this have on revenue?

Which car categories generate the most profit?

How do driver and customer ratings vary across services (Mini, Sedan, SUV, Luxury)?

What are the peak booking periods and high-demand regions?

‚Ä¢ Goal of the Dashboard

To deliver a single visual tool that:
‚úî Tracks Uber‚Äôs overall booking performance.
‚úî Monitors cancellations and their impact on lost revenue.
‚úî Analyzes profitability across car types.
‚úî Highlights customer and driver satisfaction levels.
‚úî Supports strategic decision-making in pricing, fleet management, and customer engagement.
